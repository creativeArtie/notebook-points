# notebook-points
The project is a gamification of my to do list/gratitude journal.

## Reason write the scripts instead of using spreadsheet

1. My computer only has 1 GB of RAM.
2. More customization over spreadsheets.
3. To add something finished on my personal profilo.

## How to uses

1. Has a small notebook handly.
2. Install `gawk`
3. Run [this file](notebook) in ubuntu system.
4. More help can be found in the script.
